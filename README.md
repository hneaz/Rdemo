Introduction

This tutorial will walk you through how to create multiple Excel files with different subset of data and 
mass emailing to the recipients in R. You will need R, Excel 2013 or 2016, a gmail account or corporate 
email account, the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Proctocol) settings of gmail or corporate email account.

Applications

This auto emailer is useful if you are sending a sales report to every sale representative who is only going 
to be viewing their own data in the report and they are receiving it through email. They will not be able to 
view other sales representative reports other than their own. Or if you are running your own business and 
you want to send your customers their monthly transaction data, then you can use this method.

Demo

For this demo, we will be using public data from the City of Chicago that shows salaries of the employees.
More information about the data set can be found here.
